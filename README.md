# microservices-job-4
Please take note that I followed the qn step by step as below. So I cloned the repo after edit the file name and the table on remote. 
I made changee to local after the remote was changed and cloned so there was no conflict to merge
If you want merge with conflict, the question should be clearer to add one more step to remind us to clone right after the repo was created.


Original question:
Create a new git repository named “microservices-job-4”
Update the title of index.html to <<your-name>> - REST client and commit to github
On the github edit index.html <table> tag to have <table class="table table-striped table-dark"> and commit the changes
On local update add another column named “website” do appropriate changes to get data from the REST API
Please do a Conflict and Merge, ensure all changes are retained
