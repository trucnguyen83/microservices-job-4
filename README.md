# microservices-job-4
Please take note that I followed the qn step by step as below. So I cloned the repo after edit the file name and the table on remote. 
I made changee to local after the remote was changed and cloned so there was no conflict to merge
If you want merge with conflict, the question should be clearer to add one more step to remind us to clone right after the repo was created.
